            <h2>How to Store Guava Cake</h2>
            <p>
                In my opinion, this cake tastes especially delicious after it has been refrigerated overnight, I suggest
                chilling the whole thing overnight in the baking pan before serving. Store any leftovers in the fridge
                for up to a week.
